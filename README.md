#### Dapps banner management

Banners serve as an essential tool for communicating urgent messages or event-related information to users across the site. The management of these banners is centralized in the Bannerconfig component, located within the `packages/shared-ui` directory. This allows for effective global notification during scenarios like RPC issues or network congestion.
For targeted communications, banners can be configured to appear on specific pages by listing the desired paths in the hrefs field. For example, to display a banner only on the "Pools," "Swap," and homepage in BEX, you would set `hrefs` to `["/pools", "/swap", "/"]`.
To modify the banner configuration, submit a PR with changes to the `enabled` field in the `bannerConfig`. This will update the banner's active status and display it as specified.
