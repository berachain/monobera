# Getting Started [Welcome to Berachain! Get started with berajs and interact with Berachain]

## Overview

Berajs is a TypeScript interface for interacting with Berachain PoL logic and core Dapps. Built on top of the [wagmi v2](https://wagmi.sh/) and [viem](https://viem.sh/) libraries, BeraJs provides a library capable of plugging into your existing [wevm](https://wevm.dev/) projects. Berajs
