# Bera Config

Bera Config is a common object used to pass configuration options to Bera. It can either be used to point towards already hosted services or be used to point towards your own services.

```ts
import { type BeraConfig } from 'berajs'
export const beraJsConfig: BeraConfig = {
  endpoints: {
    dexRouter: "https://...",
  },
  subgraphs: {
    honeySubgraph: "https://...",
    dexSubgraph: "https://...",
    lendSubgraph: "https://...",
  },
  contracts: {
    multicallAddress: "0x...",
    crocMultiSwapAddress: "0x...",
    wrappedTokenAddress: "0x...",
    dexAddress: "0x...",
  },
};
```

All fields on `BeraConfig` are optional such that if you only want to interact with dex, you can provide a minimal config like so:

```ts
import { type BeraConfig } from 'berajs'
export const beraJsConfig: BeraConfig = {
  endpoints: {
    dexRouter: "https://...",
  },
  subgraphs: {
    dexSubgraph: "https://...",
  },
  contracts: {
    multicallAddress: "0x...",
    dexAddress: "0x...",
  },
};
```

Required `BeraConfig` fields are documented on each hook / action.
